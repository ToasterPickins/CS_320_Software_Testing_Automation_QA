### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
There are many things that can be done to ensure that code is functional and secure. First, designing the code to fit to the user stories supplied at the beginning of development will help to ensure that what is built matches the functional needs of the end user. Secondly, using good secure-coding practices that adhere to industry standards will help to provide security. Lastly, testing the code during and after development will help with both areas. This will help to show that the product works as intended with no known vulnerabilities.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Working closely with the end users can help with this. Gathering user stories and working with an iterative development lifecycle can help to bring their needs into the final product. It is imperative that code be designed to fit the end user's needs as described by them instead of building software to fit these needs as defined by the programming team. Additionally, building potentially releasable solutions, showing them to the end users on a regular basis, and using their feedback for continued programming will help to ensure that the overall trajectory of development continues toward the best possible outcome for the end users' needs.

### How do I approach designing software?
I like to take an iterative approach to development. I will code a small section and test it. The results of those tests will help to finetune what I have written if needed. This class has also helped me to see the importance of designing tests prior to any significant coding. This helps me to focus on the end goal from the start and prevents a situation in which tests are designed to the code instead of the code designed to the tests.
